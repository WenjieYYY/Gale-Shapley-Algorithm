# Gale-Shapley-Algorithm
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Gale–Shapley algorithm in Python. The Gale–Shapley algorithm guarantees a stable matching between two sets of agents (e.g., students and schools, job seekers and employers) in O(n²) time.

Use this as an educational tool to understand deferred acceptance, or as a foundation for more complex matching systems.
